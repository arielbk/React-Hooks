# React Hooks Playground

It's about time I learnt about React hooks.

Notes go in here.

[React Hooks Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

I'll make a small project to practice hooks, and put it here, too. I'm not sure exactly what yet, but probably something small that fetches some data from an API and displays it.
